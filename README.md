# ProseRender

ProseRender is a library for rendering JSON documents into HTML in Rails applications. It's designed for use with content generated by [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net) based JSON documents, following the ProseMirror schema. [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev), for example, follows the ProseMirror schema.

Rails has great tools already for handling rich text, such as Action Text and the accompanying Trix editor. However, most available tools available generate and save content as HTML. This tightly couples the content and markup, making changes to markup or content independently difficult.

ProseRender provides a default set of components, leveraging the [ViewComponent](https://viewcomponent.org) library. The default set should cover any default ProseMirror or TipTap generated elements. Additionally, you are able to override any existing components, or add new component types. 

## Installation

Start by including `prose_render` in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "prose_render"
```

Then run `bundle install`.

## Usage

Usage is straight forward to get started:

```ruby
# given a ProseMirror JSON document
prose_json = {
"type": "doc",
  "content": [
    { 
      "type": "paragraph", 
      "content": [
        { 
          "type": "text", 
          "text": "Hello, world!"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

ProseRender::Document.render(prose_json)
```

## TODO

- [ ] Support for ProseMirror nodes and marks
- [ ] Support TipTap nodes and marks
- [ ] Entry point to define custom renderers
- [ ] Generators for blueprinting custom renders (e.g., for TipTap nodes)
- [ ] Support nesting passthrough via opts
